# Yhelix Insurance - Modern Web UI

A sleek, minimal, and highly animated insurance company website UI built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Inspired by the modern aesthetics of Apple.com, and Figma, this project focuses on delivering an exceptional user experience with a dark-mode-only theme. All data is handled statically or stored in `localStorage` for demonstration purposes, as no backend is required.
